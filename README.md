#Pokemon-Battle

Game rolles:
In this game, you (the player) are fighting an opponent Pokemon. Both Pokemon begin with 100 health points. The health points must be represented somehow on the screen.
- For each game, generate a random Pokemon image, both for the player and for the opponent using the following free API: https://pokeapi.co/ 
- When pressing Attack, two dice are rolled. One for each side.
- If one of the players hits 6, he can roll the dice extra time
- Each dice will show a random number between 1 and 6.
- Each side will lose the amount of points the other player scored in the dice roll
- If The player loses all their health the game stops and “Game Over” is displayed
- If the opponent loses all their health the game ends and “You Win” is displayed
- After the round is finished, the player has two options - receive a new Pokémon
or continue with the same one. If the player chooses the new Pokémon option, no results are saved. If the player chooses to continue with the same Pokémon, a simple statistic of lost/won battles is shown.
